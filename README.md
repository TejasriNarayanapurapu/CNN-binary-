CNN
CNN-Based Binary Image Classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into two categories (binary classification) using deep learning techniques.

Objective
To build and train a CNN model capable of accurately distinguishing between two classes of images — for example:

Cats vs Dogs

Defective vs Non-Defective Products

Pneumonia vs Normal Chest X-Rays

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries:

TensorFlow, Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib (for visualization)

Dataset Source: [Kaggle / Custom / Public Dataset]
